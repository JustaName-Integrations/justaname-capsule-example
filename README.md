# Example Repository: Capsule ü§ù JustaName Integration

This repository provides an example integration of two powerful tools:

- **Capsule**: An embedded wallet solution that enables cross-app experiences.
- **JustaName**: An identity layer that offers ENS subname issuance as an out-of-the-box solution for dApps.

By combining these two solutions, developers can unlock a complete user experience, where users can easily onboard, manage their wallets, and claim ENS subnames, all within the same interface.
